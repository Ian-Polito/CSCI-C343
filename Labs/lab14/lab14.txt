componentAndSizes() method works by going through all the nodes in the list of nodes in the graph and if it comes across one
that has not been visited, it increments the number of components found. Then it calls a modified version of BFS method to
check the size of the component and adds new node to the toVisit list if they are connected to the initial node given. This
allows it to print each component and their size.
