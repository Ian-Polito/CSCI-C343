The task is implemented by creating a hash table using a string as the key (for words
found in the text file) and a linked list of integers (for containing the line numbers),
Then the file name is used with the scanner that processes the text file line by line
and splitting them into strings. These strings are checked if they are already in the
table; if they are the linked list is updated with the additional line number, and if
the string is not, a new linked list is created and the word and linked list is put in
the hash table. Then for the wordQuery method, it checks if the given word is contained
in the hash table and if so, prints the line numbers where it is found, otherwise it
prints that the given word was not found.
