numberOfEdges() method was implemented by adopting the given pseudocode. The first for loop sets the Dynamic Programming
matrix to zero where we know the connection is to itself. Then the second nested for loop set checks each vertex and changes
the matrix to 1 where there is a connection to another vertex, otherwise it sets it to 999 since we don't know if there is
a connection to that vertex. Lastly, the final triple nested for loop goes through the matrix, reusing previous results to
calculate the shortest path to all vertices.
