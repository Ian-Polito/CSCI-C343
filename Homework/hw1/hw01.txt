Task B
In order to calculate the hamming distance between two DNA strings, I used a for loop to go through
the strings character by character using the String.charAt function to check if parts were different.
I used an integer to keep track of the differences. In order to test this with DNA strings of length
100, I created a new DNA string creation function that took an integer argument and made DNA strings
of arbitrary length.
