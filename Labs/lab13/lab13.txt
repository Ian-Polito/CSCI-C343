Analysis
For the counting sort to be effective, the maximum key value k should be small otherwise
the B array will take up a lot of space. If this is true the algorithm is very efficient
since in terms of the number of records n, it runs in linear time complexity.

No matter whether k is larger or smaller than n, the time complexity for counting sort is
still Big-Theta(n) since k only affects space complexity, not time.
