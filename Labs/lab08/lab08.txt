The find() method for BinNodeJr uses the compareTo method to check if the current node's
value is the same as the one we are looking for, and returns true if so. Otherwise it
recursively calls find() on the left and right nodes as long as they aren't null to keep
searching the tree for the given value.

The checkBalance() method for BSTJr starts at the root and checks the height of the left
and right nodes as long as they aren't null and ensures that the height of each does not
differ by more than one. If they do differ by more than one it returns false, otherwise it
recursively calls checkBalance() on the left and right nodes as long as they aren't null
to check if the entire tree is balanced.
