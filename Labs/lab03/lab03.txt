To implement MyCardSet, I created an instance variable deck, that is an array
of Strings which represent the 52 playing cards. The constructor of the class
calls the initialize method, which adds the cards to the deck using loops to
add strings. To randomly draw cards in the drawRandomCard method, I created
an instance of Random and used it to get a random integer between 0 and 51
inclusive, and then got the card contained in that index of deck.

To implement Tweet, I created two instance variables, content and author,
which are two strings that represent the content and author of the tweet.
The constructor for this class takes in two strings and initializes the
instance variables. The printContent method merely prints out the content
instance variable, and the contains method uses the String class's contains
method to check if the given string is contained in the Tweet's content.
