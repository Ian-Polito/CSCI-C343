Prim's algorithm for this assignment was implemented by adopting the given pseudocode for the algorithm. It starts by creating
an array dist for containing the distances to each node and makes dist[0] = 0 as the source node. It processes each node by
using the minVertex method much like Dijkstra's algorithm and increments the total cost of the MST by the dist[new node]. Then
the relaxation operation is done which for all neighbors of the current node checks if the weight between neighbors and the
current node is less than the dist[neighboring node] and sets the dist[neighboring node] to the weight between the neighbor and
the current node if so. This calculates the total cost of the MST and the dist array for the tree.
