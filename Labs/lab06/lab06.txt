To implement TweetCollection I used an LinkedList to store Tweet objects. Once initialized
in the constructor, it called a method that scans the given URL using a scanner to create
tweets and add them to the LinkedList. As far as the other operations that allow clients
to use the collection of tweets, I created a method to print all tweets that were tweeted
by a given author and a method to print tweets that contain in their content a given search
term. This was accomplished by looping through the LinkedList and printing the tweet using an
overridden toString method if the tweet's author matches the given author for the one method
and if the tweet's content contains the given search term for the other method.
