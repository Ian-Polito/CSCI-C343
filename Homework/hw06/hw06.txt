Analysis of flood() method
Since we needed to use an Iterator to be able to add to the floodList while processing the LinkedList, when a new coord is added, the
Iterator is set back to the beginning of the list. This is necessary since new coords need to be processed as well to check if their
neighbors should be added to the list as well. Ultimately this makes the flood function run at a time complexity of O(n^2), and could be
greatly improved if it were possible to add the new coord to the end of the list.

For this collaborative assignment, I programmed part of the flood() method and wrote the time complexity analysis.
